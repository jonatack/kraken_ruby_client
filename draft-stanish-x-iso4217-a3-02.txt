Registry of Unofficial Extensions to the ISO 4217 Alpha Three Currency
                Identification Namespace (X-ISO4217-A3)
                     draft-stanish-x-iso4217-a3-02


Abstract


   This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of
   identifiers for currencies or currency-like commodities lying outside
   the traditional scope of the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) 4217 alpha-3 standard, such as digital
   currencies and commodities, currencies issued by countries (nation-
   states) with limited international recognition, emerging commodities
   such as emissions reduction credits, private or commercial
   currencies, and accounting units for local exchange and trading
   systems (LETS).  Such codes are already in use; the registry simply
   codifies their existence.  This document obsoletes draft-stanish-x-
   iso4217-a3-01.

1.  Introduction


   The vast majority of multicurrency financial systems today use the
   International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 standard
   for currency identification, which provides three digit numeric and
   three letter ("alpha-3") codepoints for the identification of each
   currency.  The latter, letter-based codes are in far greater use.

   ISO4217 codepoints are registered by the International Organization
   for Standardization through the maintenance agency for the registry,
   SIX Interbank Clearing [SIX], a Swiss financial body.

   The specific terms of SIX or the ISO's mandate within the currency
   sphere do not appear to be publicly available.  However, given that
   geographically defined nation-states with some international
   recognition and physically circulating currency (such as Transnistria
   [PRB]) have not been issued currency codes, and leaving aside the
   relatively large scope for raising conflict of interest questions
   with regards to SIX's SWIFT links, it is reasonable to assume that
   SIX and the ISO's mandate and/or sphere of interest in the currency
   domain is highly unlikely to suddenly extend to emerging currency-
   like commodities lacking some or all of the political qualities
   exhibited by conventional currencies.

   At present, issued codepoints are almost exclusively linked to
   national or supra-national entities (eg. 'EUR' for the Euro, the
   currency of the European Union) that have achieved political
   recognition from the United Nations, with some exceptions for the
   more popular traditional commodities, such as gold, and various
   regional instruments backed by similar political entities.

   This is understandable, given that conventional definitions of the
   term 'currency' are often inextricably linked to the notion of
   national issue by 'countries' or nation-states:

         "a system of money in general use in a particular country"
           -- The Oxford Dictionary [OXFORD]

   Therefore currencies and currency-like commodities with far smaller
   circulation not adopting a traditional national paradigm of issue are
   unlikely to be granted a codepoint. Indeed, there is some evidence
   that SIX Interbank Clearing has rejected proposals for such
   registrations in the recent past, citing lack of a national entity
   backing a particular currency. [ISO-REJECTION]

   This situation has left both end users and system developers and
   integrators in a quandry; in response they have apparently near

   uniformly opted to respond by issuing unofficial ISO4217 alpha-3
   codes for private use.

   The present problem is that, given the recent growth of such
   unofficial codes, and the increasing exchange of such assets across
   disparate systems, no registry of unofficial codepoints exists.
   Therefore no unambiguous, internet-wide, shared vocabulary can be
   adopted by internet systems to identify this emerging class of
   assets.

   This document proposes the establishment of a registry to be
   maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in order
   to resolve this issue by creating an unofficial, parallel namespace
   codifying such unofficial extensions to the ISO4217 alpha-3 official
   standard, tracking present and future unofficial assignments.

   Examples of currencies or currency-like commodities for which systems
   may benefit from such registration include decentralized digital
   currencies such as Bitcoin [BITCOIN], the upcoming Ripple Credit
   [XRP], private currency systems [SLL], and regional currencies of
   limited political recognition [PRB] [TEM].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  X-ISO4217-A3


   Official [ISO4217] codepoints shall be considered a subset of a
   larger namespace, based upon a longer machine-format codepoint,
   providing unambiguous identification of currencies and currency-like
   commodities both within and beyond conventional ISO4217 assignment.
   However, existing end user expectations regarding three-character
   ('a3code') format and presentation are respected.

   Systems implementers providing X-ISO4217-A3 support remain safe in
   the knowledge that they will have the capacity to support all ISO4217
   alpha-3 codepoints in addition to arbitrary currencies and currency-
   like commodities.


2.1.  Examples


   The Euro is encoded as 'ZEUR'.

   The digital currency or currency-like commodity known as Bitcoin is
   encoded as 'XBTC'.


2.2.  Source Registry Identification

   In order to issue superset-compatible currency and currency-like
   commodity identifiers within the [ISO4217] scheme, a prefix character
   is introduced denominating the source registry, being either this
   IANA-managed and unofficial registry (denoted with 'X') or the
   official ISO-managed registry (denoted with 'Z').

   The 'X' notation is chosen as is the standard semantic for unofficial
   extensions within internet drafts.  The 'Z' notation is chosen as a
   less frequently used opening consonant in Roman languages, thus
   reducing the likelihood of unfortunate four-letter linguistic
   connotations.


2.3.  Codepoint Identification

   The X-ISO4217-A3 format may be expressed in ABNF [RFC5234] as
   follows:

    codepoint    = registry a3code       ; eg: 'XBTC', 'ZEUR'

    registry     = reg-x / reg-z         ; ie: capital 'X', capital 'Z'

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 26, 2013            November 2012


    reg-x        = %d88                  ; X-ISO4217-A3 (IANA managed)
    reg-z        = %d90                  ; ISO4217-A3 (ISO managed)

    a3code       = 3caps-letter          ; eg: 'EUR', 'BTC'

    caps-letter  = %d65 / %d66 / %d67 / %d68 / %d69 / %d70 / %d71 /
                   %d72 / %d73 / %d74 / %d75 / %d76 / %d77 / %d78 /
                   %d79 / %d80 / %d81 / %d82 / %d83 / %d84 / %d85 /
                   %d86 / %d87 / %d88 / %d89 / %d90   ; ie. capital A-Z


   An explanation of the major elements follows.

   codepoint:
     A structurally valid X-ISO4217-A3 codepoint in machine format, ie.
     including the registry identifier.

   registry:
     A character identifying the source registry of the subsequent
     'a3code' being either 'X' (denoting this registry, managed by IANA)
     or 'Z' (denoting the official ISO4217 registry, managed by SIX on
     behalf of the ISO).

   a3code:
     Alpha-three code. A three letter alphanumeric string identifying a
     specific currency or currency-like commodity within the prior
     'registry', as presently used within ISO4217 and unofficial
     extensions to the ISO4217 system, for example: 'EUR' (official ISO
     code denoting the Euro) or 'BTC' (widely used code denoting
     Bitcoin [BITCOIN]).



3.  Implementation Considerations


3.1.  Input


3.1.1.  Formats

   For legacy reasons, input MAY be accepted in either of two formats:

    Three character (X-ISO4217-A3 'a3code') format:
      This is the format most familiar to end users, ie. codes such as
      'MYR' (Malaysian Ringgit) or 'SLL' (Second Life Linden Dollar).
      This code format excludes an explicit registry identifier.  This
      format MAY be supported.



The IFEX Project / ifex-project.org             Section 3.1.1.  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 26, 2013            November 2012


    Four character (X-ISO4217-A3) format:
      The full X-ISO4217-A3 four character format, including an explicit
      registry identifier.  For example, 'ZMYR' (Malaysian Ringgit) or
      'XSLL' (Second Life Linden Dollar).  This format MUST be supported
      in all cases.


3.1.2.  End User Input

   Systems accepting input from end users MUST accept codepoints from
   each registry in an equal fashion, such that end users are NOT aware
   of any difference between individual registries.


3.1.2.1.  a3code Input

   Implementations MAY allow 'a3code' input.  In this case,
   implementations MUST normalize input to a complete an unambiguous X-
   ISO4217-A3 codepoint immediately, using the following algorithm:

    - If the 'a3code' exists within a single registry, normalize to that
      X-ISO4217-A3 code.  The implementation SHOULD confirm or report on
      the result of normalization.

    - If the 'a3code' exists within multiple registries, NOT marked
      as an historic allocation ('is_historic' field), the
   implementation
      MUST NOT normalize the value.  The implementation MUST return an
      error.  The implementation MAY provide the appropriate subset of
      normalization options to the end user or peer system to assist
   with
      building an additional query using properly normalized input.


3.1.3.  Case Sensitivity

   Implementations MAY accept mixed or lower case input, but MUST
   normalize this input to (structurally valid) upper case prior to
   processing or storage.  For relevant security considerations, see
   Case Normalization.


3.2.  Output

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 26, 2013            November 2012


3.2.1.  Machine Presentation

   Implementations MUST present upper case only, normalized
   (structurally valid), four character X-ISO4217-A3 identifiers to peer
   systems.

   For example, 'XVER' (Non Kyoto Protocol Verified Emissions Reduction
   CO2 Tonne).


3.2.2.  End User Presentation


   For user presentation purposes, systems MAY present the 'a3code'
   element to end users rather than the full X-ISO4217-A3 codepoint (eg:
   'BTC' instead of 'XBTC').  In such cases, adequate context SHOULD be
   given in order to prevent ambiguity.  Adequate context MAY include
   the option to view the full X-ISO4217-A3 codepoint, the human
   language currency name, and the source registry, AND/OR the
   reconfirmation of any initiated operation with such clarifying
   contextual information added prior to its actual execution.


3.3.  Internationalization

   The registry MAY include currency and entity names as arbitrary UTF8
   strings.

   To aid the international recognition of individual codepoints,
   implementations MUST present only upper case normalized (structurally
   valid) identifiers to both peer systems and end users.  (See Case
   Sensitivity).


4.  Security Considerations

   X-ISO4217-A3 only provides a currency or currency-like commodity
   identification scheme and DOES NOT approach problems of
   communications security, which are purposefully left to other
   protocols.  Even so, some security considerations are are pertinent.


4.1.  Input








The IFEX Project / ifex-project.org               Section 4.1.  [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 26, 2013            November 2012


4.1.1.  Input Confirmation

   Because there is always some scope for error in systems requiring end
   user input (see Case Normalization), unambiguous confirmation of
   input SHOULD be provided.  Such confirmation MAY include the full X-
   ISO4217-A3 codepoint, the human language currency name, and the
   source registry.


4.1.2.  Case Normalization

   It should be noted with regards to case normalization that some
   frequency of manual recognition (or transposition) errors is likely
   to occur whenever input is sought.  This frequency increases in
   situations where an end user does not have linguistic or other types
   of clues regarding a source document's probable vocabulary or
   semantics, or is simply unfamiliar with the material.  Machine-style
   codes, such as X-ISO4217-A3, therefore fall in to a relatively high
   risk area, albiet one that conventional ISO4217 systems are also
   vulnerable to.

   When considering the implementation of X-ISO4217-A3 systems that
   accept lower or mixed-case input, implementers SHOULD consider
   carefully whether case normalization is an appropriate choice for
   their systems, given that the scope for such errors is nominally
   (though not hugely) increased.  (For example, an input of 'Z' could
   come from a user misunderstanding a lowercase 'r', or an input of 'U'
   could come from a user misunderstanding a lowercase 'a'.)  To some
   extent this issue SHOULD be mitigated by the requirement that
   implementations MUST present only upper case (structurally valid)
   codepoints both to peer systems and end users.


4.2.  IANA Processes

   IANA MUST provide adequate authentication of registrant institution
   communications in order to prevent the subversion of established
   institutions' registration information via IANA's registrar
   functions.



5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Name Space Exhaustion

   Should the entire IANA-managed portion of the X-ISO4217-A3 namespace
   approach registration, IANA MUST immediately select an additional



The IFEX Project / ifex-project.org              Section 5.1.  [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 26, 2013            November 2012


   registry prefix.


5.2.  Registration

   Codepoints MUST be assigned by IANA on a first come first served
   basis [RFC5226].  To support innovation, in contrast to conventional
   financial registries, codepoints MUST be issued to ANY registrant
   supplying a valid domain name and reasonable information.

   Registrants MUST provide the domain name with which their service is
   primarily associated AND the name of the registrant (either a person
   or an organizational entity), as well as the appropriate contents for
   the registry fields.

   Registrants MAY request a specific codepoint, or IANA MAY assign them
   one.


5.3.  Modification / Cancellation

   Due to the nature of currency and currency-like commodity
   identification between disparate financial systems, codepoint
   allocations are permanent and binding.  However, modifications to
   metadata are possible and SHOULD be effected by IANA within a few
   working days.  IANA should update the 'modified' field of the
   registry entry in question to reflect the fact that modification has
   taken place.


5.4.  Publication


   IANA SHALL publish revisions to the global registry of X-ISO4217-A3
   codes as changes are made.

   IANA SHALL, where possible, attempt to include any and all changes to
   the ISO4217 official codepoints within the registry.  Whilst the
   copyright status of the codepoints remains unclear, they are
   distributed freely to the public and have been widely republished in
   open sources such as Wikipedia for an extended period, so should not
   be of legal concern.  IANA MAY contact the author for the code that
   was used to compile the ISO distributed code lists in to the registry
   format in order to assist with ongoing maintenance.

   IANA SHALL provide GPG-compatible cryptographic signatures along with
   each version of the registry.  IANA MAY provide additional
   cryptographic signatures and/or checksums at their sole discretion.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 26, 2013            November 2012


   The registry SHALL utilize UTF8 encoding in order to meet
   internationalization requirements for institution names.

   The format and initial contents of this registry document are
   specified in Appendix A.


5.5.  ISO Liason

   IANA SHOULD formally notify [SIX] (as the maintenance agency of the
   ISO4217 registry) of the existence of this registry.  IANA SHOULD
   make [SIX] feel welcome to forward parties unsuccessful in their
   applications for ISO4217 codepoints to IANA, in order to acquire
   alternate codepoint registrations within the IANA-managed X-
   ISO4217-A3 registry.


5.5.1.  Resolving Duplicate Assignment

   In addition, the ISO MAY wish to inform IANA of any upcoming
   codepoint additions that will effect duplicate allocation between the
   X-ISO4217-A3 and ISO4217 registries.  In the event of such a
   duplicate assignment, which is perceived as unlikely to occur outside
   of exceptional cases, IANA SHOULD add a new, optional field
   indicating external registry codepoint equivalence to X-ISO4217-A3
   registry records.


5.6.  Security

   IANA MUST provide adequate authentication of registrant institution
   communications in order to prevent the subversion of established
   codepoints' metadata via IANA's registrar functions.

   As IANA is likely to have superior experience in this domain,
   specific procedures are left to IANA's judgement.

                    Relevant excerpt:
                     "I also understand you have previously denied
                      such requests with the following statements:
                       1. The currency code is not linked to any
                          country code.
                       2. The currency code is considered a
                          'private currency' and not used for
                          tender in any country.
                       3. There will be no international payments
                          denominated in Bitcoin therefore an ISO
                          currency code for the Bitcoin is not
                          applicable.
                       4. The Institution responsible for the
                          Bitcoin does not appear to be recognized
                          internationally or have any official
                          status. Neither Reuters or Bloomberg

10.  Appendix B: ISO4217 Registry Issues

In researching this document the following issues were observed within
the ISO4217 registry publications provided at http://www.currency-
iso.org/:

 Indistinct Requirements for Issue:
  As discussed earlier in this document, there does not
  appear to be any publicly available definition of the
  requirements for codepoint registration within the
  traditional ISO 4217 registry.  Combined with observed
  behaviors in denying registration requests, this fact
  highlights the need for alternate registries.

 Possible Conflict of Interest:
  The present registry maintenance agency for ISO 4217 is
  SIX Interbank Clearing, a Swiss entity that is strongly
  affiliated with the existing SWIFT interbank clearing
  network.  Due to the innovative privision of alternate
  international settlement paradigms provided by some
  emerging electronic currencies and currency-like
  commodities ([BITCOIN], etc.) this raises the question
  of conflict of interest.

 Historical Codepoint Division:
  The lack of a unified distribution of current and historic
  codepoints (properties, single publication source, etc.)
  requires manual coordination and processing that is
  problematic for implementors.

 Lack of Codepoint Divisions:
  There is no division within the ISO 4217 registry
  publications regarding meta-assignments (such as test
  codes and codes for organization-internal use) and normal
  codepoints, nor between currency-like commodities and
  conventional nationally linked currencies, nor between
  currencies or currency-like commodities of decentralized
  (non-consolidated) issue vs. conventional, national
  currencies.  This means that the majority of implementors
  who do not wish to handle certain codepoint types (for
  instance, the Swiss WIR mutual credit clearing system,
  special drawing rights or accounting units used in
  specific organizations such as the African Development
  Bank) face a requirement for the definition of ad-hoc
  codepoint subsets for display purposes.
